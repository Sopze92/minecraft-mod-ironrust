## Description
Feels weird that copper oxidizes but iron doesn't? Well... this small mod solves that by implementing oxide into iron in a seamless way for a nice vanilla integration

## Important Note
In case you decide to remove this Mod: I've also made an Uninstaller-Mod-Tool (Single-player only) (currently only available for Fabric) that automatically reverts all oxidized iron to Vanilla one during normal gameplay. The IronRust-Uninstaller is can only be found in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Sopze92/minecraft-mod-ironrust/releases).
